# Train Game
My idea for a train game.

## TODO:
- [ ] Goal - Transport points from side to side
- [ ] Not too many points should be in one node, else a punishment
- [ ] Node size is varied by the amount of points it holds
- [ ] Use a limited number of lines
- [ ] Make the game timed, more points for faster etc.
- [ ] Make good use of colours
- [ ] Use different colours for different nodes that transmit points faster / slower
- [ ] Use different colour point transmitters for how many points they transmit
- [ ] Set a random chance for a point transmitter to transmit more points
- [x] Put number of points transmitted by point transmitter on the front
- [ ] Make paths appear thicker to show how many lines are stacked upon another / move points faster for more lines
- [ ] Maybe incorporate different types of lines, that transmit faster / slower etc.
- [ ] Make lines coloured
- [ ] Make some stations have a reward for visiting them
- [x] Make the ends boxes instead of dots.
